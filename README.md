# simplePythonCollection
Collection of small, general Python projects


Primarily, the purpose of this repository is to keep touch with and expand my knowledge of Python. 
 As I grow, the projects will grow more complex too. 
 Overall, this is meant to be thought of as a repository to "document and track my growth."
